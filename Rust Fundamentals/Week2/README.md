# Rust Fundamentals

_Rust Bootcamp week 2: Rust Fundamentals_

This week, you will learn how to create a Rust project using Cargo and how all files and components work together. Additionally, you will understand variables, assignment, and controlling flow with logic, loops and other conditional statements. Finally, you'll create functions and get used to the borrowing concept in Rust as well as working with error handling using `match`.

This is week 2 of the Rust Bootcamp. There are 4 weeks in total:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) 
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-fundamentals) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-structs-types-enums/)
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/applied-rust)

ðŸ’¡ Are you just looking for a ðŸ‘‰ [Rust template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) to get started easily with a project? The [template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) has everything you need!

## Contents
This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.
