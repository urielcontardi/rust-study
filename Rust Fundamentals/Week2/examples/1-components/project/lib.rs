// The lib.rs file is a special one in Rust. It is the crate root, and it is the first file 
// that the compiler looks for when compiling a crate. In this case, the crate is a library, 
// so the crate root is the root of the library. 
// The crate root is where documentation comments go, and it is where you declare what modules are in the library.
