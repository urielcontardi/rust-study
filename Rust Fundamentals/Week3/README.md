# Rust Structs, Types, and Enums

_Rust Bootcamp week 3: Structs, Types, and Enums_

This week, you will learn how to create structs, types, and enums as well defining new types and extending them. You will use types like `String` and manipulate other data structures like vectors and hash maps. `Enum`s in Rust are similar to `enum`s in other languages, but they have some interesting features that make them more powerful like the `Option` and `Result` types that can be used to handle errors with `match` expressions.

This is week 3 of the Rust Bootcamp. There are 4 weeks in total:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) 
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-fundamentals) 
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-structs-types-enums/) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/applied-rust)

ðŸ’¡ Are you just looking for a ðŸ‘‰ [Rust template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) to get started easily with a project? The [template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) has everything you need!

## Contents
This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

### Lesson 1: Using structured data
- [Defining structs](./examples/1-defining-structs/)
- [Creating struct instances](./examples/2-creating-structs/)
- [Associated functions and constructors](./examples/3-associated-functions/)
- [Extending with methods](./examples/4-methods/)
- [Using the debug attribute](./examples/5-more-structs/)

### Lesson 2: Exploring strings and vectors
- [Understanding String and str](./examples/6-strings/)
- [Getting started with Rust string manipulation](./examples/7-mut-string/)
- [Basics of Vectors](./examples/8-vectors/)
- [Retrieving values from Vectors](./examples/9-vector-values/)
- [Adding elements to Vectors](./examples/10-vector-elements/)

### Lesson 3: Working with Enum and variants
- [Defining an Enum](./examples/11-enums/)
- [Using Enum as a Type](./examples/12-enum-types/)
- [The Option Enum](./examples/13-option-enum/)
- [Match and Enums](./examples/14-match-enums/)
- [Using Vectors with Enums](./examples/15-enums-vectors/)
- [Exhaustive matches](./examples/16-exhaustive/)

### Lesson 4: Practice Lab
Use the included [practice lab](./lab.md) to apply the content you've learned in this week. Follow the steps to create your own repository and apply the requirements to complete the lab.
